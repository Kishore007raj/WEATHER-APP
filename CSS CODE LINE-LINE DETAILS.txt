CSS CODE LINE-LINE FULL EXPLANATION

STEP-1-ADDING A BG AND ALSO A BOX-LIKE CONTAINER 

* {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    padding: 0px;
    margin: 0;
}

body {
    display: flex;
    background: url("weather images/neon.png");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    margin: 0;
}

.container {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
    width: 400px;
    height: 120px;
    color: white;
    backdrop-filter: blur(15px);
    border: 2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    border-radius: 20px;
    padding: 21px;
    position: relative;
    transition: height .3s ease;
}



let's break down the CSS code:

1. `*`: This is a universal selector, meaning it selects all elements on the page.

2. `font-family: Arial, sans-serif;`: This sets the font family for all elements to Arial, or if Arial is not available, to a generic sans-serif font.

3. `box-sizing: border-box;`: This ensures that padding and border are included in the element's total width and height.

4. `padding: 0px;` and `margin: 0;`: These reset the default padding and margin for all elements to 0, ensuring consistent spacing throughout the page.

5. `body`: Styles applied to the body element.

   - `display: flex;`: Makes the body a flex container, allowing its children elements to be flex items.
   - `background`: Sets the background of the body to a specified image file located in the "weather images" folder. The `url()` function is used to specify the image file path.
   - `background-size: cover;`: Ensures the background image covers the entire body element.
   - `background-position: center;`: Positions the background image at the center of the body element.
   - `min-height: 100vh;`: Sets the minimum height of the body to 100% of the viewport height, ensuring the background image covers the entire viewport.
   - `justify-content: center;` and `align-items: center;`: Centers the content horizontally and vertically within the body.
   - `margin: 0;`: Resets the margin of the body to 0.

6. `.container`: Styles applied to elements with the class "container".

   - `background`: Sets a semi-transparent white background color using RGBA values.
   - `width: 400px;` and `height: 120px;`: Sets the width and height of the container.
   - `color: white;`: Sets the text color to white.
   - `backdrop-filter: blur(15px);`: Applies a blur effect to the background of the container.
   - `border`: Sets a 2px solid border with a semi-transparent white color.
   - `border-radius: 20px;`: Rounds the corners of the container.
   - `padding: 21px;`: Adds padding inside the container.
   - `position: relative;`: Sets the positioning context for absolutely positioned elements within the container.
   - `transition: height .3s ease;`: Adds a transition effect to changes in height, with a duration of 0.3 seconds and an easing function of "ease".

Overall, this CSS sets up a visually appealing layout with a background image, centered content, and styled containers with a blur effect and transition animation.



STEP-2-ADDING A SEARCH BOX TO TYPE THE CITY NAME

.search-box {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    height: 55px;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    border-radius: 30px;
}

.search-box i {
    position: absolute;
    font-size: 25px;
    left: 10px;
    padding: 0 10px;
}

.search-box input {
    position: absolute;
    flex: 1;
    width: 100%;
    height: 90%;
    background: transparent;
    border: 2px solid #a05f9c;
    outline: none;
    border-radius: 15px;
    font-size: 21px;
    font-weight: 500;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    padding: 0 48px 0 43px;
}

.search-box input::placeholder {
    color: white;
    text-transform: capitalize;
}

.search-box button {
    position: absolute;
    right: 0;
    width: 40px;
    height: 60px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    background: transparent;
    color: aliceblue;
    font-size: 21px;
    padding: 0 30px 0 5px;
}

These styles combine to create a search box with an input field, an icon, and a button, all positioned within a flex container. The input field has specific styling for its appearance and behavior, and the icon and button are positioned absolutely for precise placement within the search box.


STEP-3-NOW CREATING-WEATHER BOX-IN WHICH IF WE TYPE SOME OTHER INVALID NAME IT WILL COME AS "NOT FOUND"
