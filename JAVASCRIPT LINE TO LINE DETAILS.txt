step-1-"GIVING THE NECESSARY HTML ELEMENTS FOR THE STYLING WITH CSS "

const container = document.querySelector(".container");
const searchbar = document.querySelector(".search-box button");
const weatherbox = document.querySelector(".weather-box");
const weatherinfo = document.querySelector(".weather-info");
const errornotfound = document.querySelector(".not-to-be-found");


meaning

These lines of JavaScript code are responsible for selecting various elements from the HTML document using their respective CSS classes.

Let's break it down:

1. `const container = document.querySelector(".container");`:
   - This line selects an HTML element with the class name "container" using the `document.querySelector()` method.
   - It assigns the reference to this HTML element to a constant variable named `container`.
   - The selected element is typically a container that holds various components of the weather application.

2. `const searchbar = document.querySelector(".search-box button");`:
   - This line selects a `<button>` element that is a child of an element with the class name "search-box".
   - It uses the `document.querySelector()` method to find the specific button element.
   - The reference to this button element is assigned to a constant variable named `searchbar`.
   - This button is likely used to trigger the search for weather information when clicked.

3. `const weatherbox = document.querySelector(".weather-box");`:
   - This line selects an HTML element with the class name "weather-box".
   - It uses the `document.querySelector()` method to find this element.
   - The reference to this element is assigned to a constant variable named `weatherbox`.
   - The "weather-box" element typically contains the display area for weather-related information such as temperature, description, and weather icon.

4. `const weatherinfo = document.querySelector(".weather-info");`:
   - This line selects an HTML element with the class name "weather-info".
   - It uses the `document.querySelector()` method to find this element.
   - The reference to this element is assigned to a constant variable named `weatherinfo`.
   - The "weather-info" element likely contains additional weather information such as humidity and wind speed.

5. `const errornotfound = document.querySelector(".not-to-be-found");`:
   - This line selects an HTML element with the class name "not-to-be-found".
   - It uses the `document.querySelector()` method to find this element.
   - The reference to this element is assigned to a constant variable named `error not found`.
   - The "not-to-be-found" element is probably a container that displays an error message when the entered location is not found or an error occurs during the weather data retrieval process.


STEP-2-NOW WE ARE GIVING THE API TO ACCESS THE REAL TIME WEATHER WITH DIFFERENT WEATHERS
searchbar.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const APIKey = "60a837dfe8e528dd4300285281a8089a";
    const city = document.querySelector(".search-box input").value;

    if (!city)
        return;

    fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&units=metric&appid=${APIKey}`)
    .then(response => response.json()).then(json => {
     
        if (json.cod == "404"){
            container.style.height = "450px"
            weatherbox.classList.remove("active");
            weatherinfo.classList.remove("active");
            errornotfound.classList.add("active");
            return;
        }

        container.style.height = "550px"
        weatherbox.classList.add("active");
        weatherinfo.classList.add("active");
        errornotfound.classList.remove("active");

        const image = document.querySelector(".weather-box img");
        const temperature = document.querySelector(".weather-box .temperature");
        const description = document.querySelector(".weather-box .description");
        const humidity = document.querySelector(".humidity-info span");
        const wind = document.querySelector(".wind-info span");



meaning:

This block of code is an event listener attached to the "click" event of the searchbar button. When the button is clicked, this code is executed. Let's break down what it does:

1. **Getting the API Key and City**:
   - It starts by defining a constant named `APIKey`, which holds the API key required for accessing the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - Then, it retrieves the value entered in the input field within the element with the class "search-box" and stores it in a constant named `city`.

2. **Checking for Empty Input**:
   - It checks if the `city` variable is empty. If it is empty, meaning no city name is entered, the function returns early and does not proceed with the API request.

3. **Fetching Weather Data**:
   - It constructs a URL using the city name and API key to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - The `fetch()` function sends a GET request to the constructed URL.
   - It then processes the response using promises. The `.then()` method is chained to handle the response asynchronously.
   - Inside the first `.then()` block, it checks if the API response contains an error (status code 404), indicating that the city was not found.
   - If the city is not found, it adjusts the height of the container element, hides the weather information elements (`weatherbox` and `weatherinfo`), and displays the error message element (`errornotfound`).
   - If the city is found, it adjusts the height of the container, shows the weather information elements, and hides the error message element.
   - Then, it extracts relevant weather information such as weather icon, temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed from the API response JSON and updates the respective elements in the HTML document accordingly.

This code effectively fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the city entered by the user, updates the UI with the retrieved information, and handles cases where the entered city is not found.



STEP-3-NOW GIVING THE SMOOTH TRANSITIONS FOR THE HUMIDITY AND WIND VALUES

 // Giving Smooth transition for temperature and description updates
        const temperature = document.querySelector(".weather-box .temperature");
        const description = document.querySelector(".weather-box .description");
        temperature.style.transition = "opacity 0.10s ease";
        description.style.transition = "opacity 0.5s ease";
        temperature.style.opacity = "0";
        description.style.opacity = "0";

        // Delayed update of temperature and description for smooth transition effect
        setTimeout(() => {
            temperature.textContent = `${json.main.temp} °C`;
            description.textContent = json.weather[0].description;
            temperature.style.opacity = "1";
            description.style.opacity = "1";
        }, 500);

        // Smooth transition for humidity and wind updates
        const humidity = document.querySelector(".humidity-info span");
        const wind = document.querySelector(".wind-info span");
        humidity.style.transition = "opacity 0.5s ease";
        wind.style.transition = "opacity 0.5s ease";
        humidity.style.opacity = "0";
        wind.style.opacity = "0";

        // Delayed update of humidity and wind for smooth transition effect
        setTimeout(() => {
            humidity.textContent = `${json.main.humidity}%`;
            wind.textContent = `${json.wind.speed} Km/Hr`;
            humidity.style.opacity = "1";
            wind.style.opacity = "1";
        }, 500);
    });
});

 Let's break down the THE LAST PART  to the JavaScript code:

1. **Smooth Transition for Temperature and Description**:
   - In the original code, temperature and description values were updated directly without any transition effect.
   - To make the update smoother, we added a transition effect to their opacity property. This transition will make the elements fade in and out smoothly when their values change.
   - Here's how it works:
     - We first set the transition property for temperature and description elements to control their opacity change. This is done using the `style.transition` property.
     - We set the `opacity` of both elements to `0`, making them invisible.
     - After a short delay (0.5 seconds in this case), we update the temperature and description values fetched from the API.
     - Finally, we set the opacity back to `1`, making them visible again. This change in opacity will be animated smoothly due to the transition effect we applied earlier.

2. **Smooth Transition for Humidity and Wind**:
   - Similar to temperature and description, we added a smooth transition effect to humidity and wind values.
   - We followed the same approach of setting the transition effect for opacity, setting opacity to `0`, updating the values, and then setting opacity back to `1` after a short delay.

Overall, these modifications enhance the user experience by providing smooth transitions when updating weather information. Instead of abrupt changes, the elements fade in and out gracefully, making the update process more visually appealing. Adjustments to the transition duration and delay can be made to fine-tune the effect based on design preferences.
